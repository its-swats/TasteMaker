It is an iOS App written in Meteor designed to allow users to scan wines and answer questions about them in order to get a recommendation on another wine that they might enjoy. 

To run, you must have Xcode. Clone the project and run 'meteor run ios-device', and then launch the app on your phone, or in the iOS Simulator.
